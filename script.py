# --- Configuration ---
# Set your Stripe secret API key.
# This can be set as an environment variable for security:
# os.environ['STRIPE_API_KEY'] = 'your_stripe_secret_key'
# Or you can hard-code it here for testing (not recommended for production):
stripe.api_key = os.environ.get('STRIPE_API_KEY')

# Define the input and output file names
INPUT_CSV_FILE = 'products.csv'

# --- CSV File Setup ---
# The input CSV file should have at least the following columns:
# 'name': The name of the product or item.
# 'amount_usd': The price of the item in USD. Other currencies can be used.

# Example of `products.csv` content:
# name,amount_usd,customer_id,order_number
# Product A,15.99,cust_123,ORD-001
# Service B,50.00,cust_456,ORD-002
